# YouTube Dataset Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis Findings

### Video Metrics
- The data includes view counts, like counts, and comment counts for each video, providing insights into audience engagement.

### Sentiment Analysis
- Comments for selected videos were analyzed for sentiment, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- This provides insights into audience reactions.

### Word Cloud Generation
- A word cloud was created from video comments, visualizing frequently used terms and potentially revealing common themes or topics of discussion.

### Thumbnail Analysis
- Dominant colors were extracted from video thumbnails, and contrast between background and foreground colors was calculated.
- This data can be used to explore potential correlations between thumbnail aesthetics and video performance.

### Correlation Analysis
- The analysis explored correlations between thumbnail features (colors and contrast) and view counts, which could indicate potential relationships between visual elements and video popularity.
